- 👋 Hi, my name is Giovanna Lima
- 👀 I come for another field, but got a huge interest on programming and since some months decided to try to learn it. 
- 💭 I have made some small courses about Programming Logical, HTML and CSS
- ✨ But what really got my interest are the Back End tecnologies
- 🌱 Because of this I have been focusing now on learning Phyton!
- 💬 I speak Portuguese, English and German. 
- 💡 Feel free to contact me if you have in mind a funny colaboration in a project involving Phyton!
